                It is said in many Sinnoh legends that the universe, 
                Pokémon world included, was created by a single Pokémon, Arceus. 
                In a void of nothingness, a single Egg came into being, which then hatched into Arceus.
                Arceus creates Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina and gives Dialga and Palkia the abilities to control time and space.
                Giratina is banished into another dimension for its behavior. 
                Then, during very early formation of the world, possibly sooner, Arceus creates Azelf, Uxie, and Mesprit to create willpower, knowledge, and emotion, respectively, attributes that are in all modern humans and Pokémon. 
                After the formation of the Sinnoh region, they dive to the bottom of present-day Lake Valor, Lake Acuity, and Lake Verity, respectively, dubbing the term "the lake guardians." Also in these early times, Mew appeared on the planet, containing the DNA of every Pokémon.
                There are many scientists who believe that Mew was the ancestor of all Pokémon.

                The next to come into being during the primal age are Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and Rayquaza. 
                It has been speculated that Primal Groudon was formed deep inside the earth from magma and Primal Kyogre was formed by the pressure in the deep sea trenches, while Rayquaza was formed by the minerals of the ozone layer.
                Another theory exists that the three already existed before the oceans, lands, and ozone layer did, and rather proceeded to create these components of the planet themselves. 
                Rayquaza proceeds to fly around in the ozone layer, occasionally coming to rest at the Sky Pillar. Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre proceed to create landmass and fill the sea, respectively. 
                A chance meeting turns the two into rivals, and a conflict for dominance over the Pokémon world begins. Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre also fought for the entry of nature that was overflowing at the time.
                These endless clashes continued until Mega Rayquaza quells it, causing Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre to retreat to special caverns, where they rest, losing their Primal Forms sometime after they went to sleep.
                The Red and Blue Orbs are created to prevent the reawakening of Groudon and Kyogre, and to trigger the Primal Reversion when either Groudon and Kyogre are awakened by the representing orbs. The Red and Blue Orbs were left at Mt. Pyre for safekeeping.

                At this time, Mew may have been plentiful and lived in large numbers. 
                Landmasses such as Mt. Coronet are created, and Regigigas moves the continents, forming various regions.
                The Sinnoh region is created around Mt. Coronet. During this violent procedure, Stark Mountain is created and Heatran is formed in lava.
                Arceus creates the Adamant, Lustrous and Griseous Orbs before falling into a never-ending sleep.
